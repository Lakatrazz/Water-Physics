## How To Setup

Drag and drop Water Volume prefab into the scene. Without further configuration, rigidbodies inside it will float.
No need for tags or layers (although, default Water layer has been added to prefabs)
To tweak more specifically how a floating object behaves, add BuoyancyMaterial to it. By default, rigidbodies will sink slowly.
It will also work for compound colliders.
